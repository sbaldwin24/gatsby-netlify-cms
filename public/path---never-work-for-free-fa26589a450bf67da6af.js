Whilst working on the project he kept hurrying me and pestering me if I finished making it yet -which really pissed me off because it felt like he was the boss of me-.Anyways, I ended up receiving bad marks on the exams, but I at least finished the static part of the website. </p>\n<p>I used html5/SCSS, some JQUERY &#x26; of course a framework called Materialize CSS which takes care of the responsive media queries, then I started preparing the database &#x26; started coding the backend using PHP/MYSQL, I asked for some help from my friend Anas Mazouni to help me make the like button work, make a views counter and overall make the website more secure. </p>\n<p>The teacher paid for the domain name &#x26; the host, and I published it on my portfolio Behance: <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/46963503/Quotes-of-Boss-web-app">Here</a> &#x26; Instagram twice : <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BO0f_O_AhC7">First</a> &#x26; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPIBhn5gn6h">Second</a>.</p>\n<p>He then asked me to add other things like social media accounts, PayPal &#x26; Patreon accounts, Google Ads &#x26; analytics, the Facebook comments box, and another page where his YouTube videos would be posted. I accepted and did as he asked. </p>\n<p>A few weeks later he asked me to add a search bar, poems &#x26; other pages for quotes &#x26; poems in Arabic &#x26; French, but this time I informed him that what he was asking for would cost him a lot –thousands of dollars kind of a lot-, but I was ready to do it for only 200$. Mr English teacher ends up refusing my ever so generous offer, blocked me from all Social Medias and asked another student to add everything for him for free. </p>\n<p>The student –who was a classmate of mine- backstabbed me and claimed that I downloaded everything &#x26; that I had never created anything on my own. The teacher later on came to me, insulted me &#x26; started spreading lies and rumors about me.</p>\n<p>To conclude, if you’re good at something, never do it in free.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/quotesof-35cbfd32d745437b78be3ef48ce54a6a-5025c.jpeg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative;
